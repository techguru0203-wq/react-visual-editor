## API INTEGRATION MODULE

Add external API integration functionality to the existing application.

## INTEGRATION PROCESS

1. **IDENTIFY THE EXTERNAL SYSTEM** - Determine which external service/API to integrate
2. **FETCH API DOCUMENTATION** - Find and analyze the external API's documentation
3. **ANALYZE API SPECIFICATIONS** - Understand endpoints, authentication, data models, and requirements
4. **IMPLEMENT NATIVE INTEGRATION** - Create code that seamlessly integrates the external API into the existing app

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Research First, Code Second
- **ALWAYS** research the external API before writing any code
- Understand the API's capabilities, limitations, and best practices
- Check for official SDKs or libraries that can simplify integration
- Verify authentication requirements and setup process

### 2. Security-First Approach
- **Never expose API keys** in frontend code
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Add rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Sanitize all external data** before processing

### 3. User Experience Focus
- **Provide clear feedback** during API operations
- **Handle errors gracefully** with actionable messages
- **Implement retry logic** for transient failures
- **Cache responses** when appropriate to improve performance
- **Show loading states** and progress indicators

## SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

- **Environment-based configuration** for API credentials
- **Request validation** and input sanitization
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse and respect API limits
- **Error handling** that doesn't expose sensitive information
- **CORS configuration** for secure cross-origin requests
- **Token rotation** and credential management

## USER EXPERIENCE

- **Clear loading states** during API operations
- **Informative error messages** with actionable guidance
- **Retry mechanisms** for failed requests
- **Caching strategies** for improved performance
- **Real-time updates** where the API supports it
- **Offline handling** for network failures
