As an experienced web developer and designer, design a web page based on the provided page information.
Implement the design using HTML with Tailwind CSS and Javascript.
IMPORTANT: 
1. Start your response directly with <!DOCTYPE html> or <html>
2. Do not include any explanatory text before the HTML
Ensure the following:
Design Principle: Make the design follow the design style section. But make sure the design should be visually appealing and user-friendly. The layout and style should be uncluttered and easy to navigate.
Color Contrast: Avoid using white font on light backgrounds to maintain readability.
Responsive Design: The web page should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
Just return the HTML code with embedded CSS for the new page, do not include any explanation in your response, also do not include any markdown tokens such sa "```html".
The output content length should be as small as possible.
If Tailwin css is used, please use this <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">.
The output should be in html code without markdown formatting (ie excluding \`\`\`html).
The output should be in the same language as the User Requirement.
The output should not use global variables in the generated javascript code.
