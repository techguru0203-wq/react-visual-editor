Mission           Amber Kinetics’ mission is to provide an emission-free, economical and safe energy storage solution – creating reliable and sustainable energy infrastructure around the world. Sustainability is in our DNA as a company. While we focus on delivering this mission globally, we also recognize the importance of evaluating our own product, supply chain and operations for opportunities to reduce our carbon footprint today and in the future. Our flywheels consist of a simple yet powerful steel design and use readily and widely available materials. We do not rely on rare earth materials, resulting in a less carbon intense manufacturing process.           Our Global Operations   Amber Kinetics' head office and centre of expertise is located in Union City, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. From our main office we design our next generation models, performing mechanical, electronic and software engineering and testing our new designs. Our workshops assemble and test flywheels, flywheel management systems, and all balance of systems components. Our 2 state of the art manufacturing facilities are located in Philippine Special Economic Zones benefiting from duty holidays and access to cutting edge eastern markets. Our manufacturing plants are capable of producing 4000 units a year, operating a LEAN best practice and regular Kaizen activities.
